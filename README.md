## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members


### Three main questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members

### Methods Used

* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Case Study


### Technologies
* R 
* Tableau
